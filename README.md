## Data Sources

All transit data comes from the
[Lodz Open Data portal](https://otwarte.miasto.lodz.pl/):

| Feed | Format | Update frequency |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| Vehicle positions | GTFS Realtime (protobuf) | Polled every 5s |
| Trip updates | GTFS Realtime (protobuf) | Polled every 15s |
| Service alerts | GTFS Realtime (protobuf) | Polled every 60s |
| Schedule data | GTFS Static (CSV in ZIP) | Downloaded on first launch, refreshed weekly |

## Architecture

The app follows MVVM with Jetpack Compose, TomTom Maps SDK for map rendering,
Room for local GTFS storage, and OkHttp for network requests.

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full architecture
documentation including data flow diagrams, database schema, and component
relationships.
